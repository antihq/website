Terrific Form is a service that helps you easily create form endpoints. This allows you to use the convenience of the HTML form tag to have an instant backend for handling your web forms without needing to develop a backend yourself. It is convenient for static websites or any other website builder platform that does not provide form handling, is an expensive paid add-on, or is not as easy to use as Terrific Form.

To use Terrific Form, simply create a form with a name for your internal reference, and we will generate a form endpoint for you. You can use this endpoint in the `action` attribute of the HTML `form` tag to start receiving web form submissions. This way, you are free to design the form however you want, using your own CSS and any form fields you choose. All form submissions are stored in your Terrific Form account, where you can view a list of all your submissions from your panel. You will also receive an email notification whenever a new submission is received. The use of the `action` attribute is universal, making it completely compatible with any web builder service or web stack.

Terrific Form costs $79 MXN per year, allowing you to create unlimited forms and receive unlimited submissions. You can start with a 30-day free trial, after which it will cost only $79 MXN per year.
