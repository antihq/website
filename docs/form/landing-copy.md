## Headline

## Subheadline
Instant form handling for static sites and site builders. 30‑day free trial, then 79 MXN/year for unlimited forms and submissions.

## Ideal for

## Body copy (AIDA)

### Attention
No backend. No deploy. No fuss.  
Point your form at a single URL and start receiving submissions in minutes.

### Interest
Create a named form in seconds, copy the generated endpoint, paste it into your form’s action — submissions land in your account and trigger email notifications. Keep your HTML and styling exactly as you designed it; Terrific Form only captures the data you send it.

### Desire
Never worry about SMTP configs, server security, or form hosting again. Unlimited forms and unlimited submissions for one low annual price makes lead capture predictable and affordable. View submission history, search past entries, and get notified the moment a lead arrives — perfect for landing pages, portfolios, and brochure sites where every message matters.

## Objection-handling (defanged)
- Concerned about privacy? Submissions are stored securely and accessible only to authorized account users — even if you need a full export, support can provide CSV or JSON.  
- Worried about security? All endpoints use HTTPS and industry-standard protections — even if you don’t manage servers, data is encrypted in transit.  
- Need integrations or webhooks? You can export data manually now — even if automated webhooks aren’t live yet, you can pull CSV/JSON exports and import into your tools.  
- Prefer self-hosting? This is a hosted service built for convenience — even if you later want to migrate, support can export your submissions for a clean transition.
